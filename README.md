A playable build of this game for Windows can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4ud2fkW3QixNC03cEpYaV93LUU

You are a scientist who has created an inter-dimensional portal generator. When testing it on yourself, you have been transported to a parallel dimension called HellWorld, but due to a mathematical error on your part, some segment of you is still stuck on Earth. Moreover, the device has fallen apart and the pieces are strewn all over HellWorld. 

HellWorld looks a lot like Earth, but it's dark, ruined, and there's a mysterious presence around that makes you nervous...

Upon starting the game, you find yourself in a tutorial room. You can move around using the WASD keys / left analog stick, and look around using the mouse / right analog stick. Pick up the piece of the portal generator in front of you (indicated by the blue glow). In the next area, there is a table that you can interact with (indicated by a white glow when you approach) and move out of the way by picking up (right mouse button / left bumper) and throwing (left mouse button / right bumper). This convention applies to all interactible objects in the game.

The next area is blocked in HellWorld... However, you realize you can still access your torn self in the real world using the E key / Y button, which will open certain paths that you might not be aware of. However, to prevent a painful death, you will switch back within a few seconds.

Once you exit the room, you are on your own. You may make use of your limited sprinting ability by pressing Left Shift / A button, and can jump using Space / X button. You must collect the remaining pieces of the generator and make it back alive to the broken generator, situated behind the starting room.

Best of luck!
